# Max-SAT Solver Using Simulated Annealing

This max-sat solver is written in Python3 for IUT AI class no idea if it works correctly 🤷‍♂️ but it works just enough 😐 at least for me :))   

samples and homework documents are included (this code is related to question 5)   


## Usage

```bash

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 sat-solver-v2.py

```
